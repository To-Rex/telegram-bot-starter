# Python Telegram Bot

Template for quick deployment using [python-telegram-bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot) library.

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.app/template/-6JUpc?referralCode=NC4Tt6)

## Examples
The examples from the library are included in the `examples` folder. You can run them directly from the root of the repository:

- `bot.py` is the main file to run the bot.
- Separating the main logic would be a good idea.
